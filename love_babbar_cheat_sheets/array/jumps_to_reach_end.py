Minimum no. of Jumps to reach end of an array

Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 9 -> 9)
Explanation: Jump from 1st element to 2nd element as there is only 1 step.

f 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9 can be reached. So 3 jumps are made.

Output: 10
Explanation: In every step a jump is needed so the count of jumps is 10.
