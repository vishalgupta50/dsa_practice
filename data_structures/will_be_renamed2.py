Given an array A[ ] of size N,
where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates.
There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.
N = 8, M = 5
A = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}
Output: 6
