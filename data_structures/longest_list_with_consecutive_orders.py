Given an array of positive integers.
Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

N = 7
a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
Output:
6

N = 7
a[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2}
Output: 4
Explanation: The subsequence 1, 3, 4, 2 is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements
