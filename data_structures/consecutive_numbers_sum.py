"""

Given an integer N, the task is to find the number of ways to represent this number as a sum of 2 or more consecutive

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 = 2 + 3

Example 2:
Input: n = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4

Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: 4
Explanation: 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
