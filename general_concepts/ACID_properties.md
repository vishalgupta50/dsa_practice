## ACID Properties in Computer Science

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties for transactional databases, ensuring that transactions are executed in a consistent and reliable manner.

### Atomicity

Atomicity refers to the all-or-nothing nature of transactions. When a transaction begins, it takes control of all the resources it needs to complete. If any part of the transaction fails, the whole transaction is rolled back and any changes made are undone. This ensures that the database remains in a consistent state even if errors or failures occur.

### Consistency

Consistency refers to the requirement that a transaction must bring the database from one valid state to another. This means that the database must adhere to a set of predefined rules and constraints, such as ensuring that the balance of an account remains positive after a transaction is executed. If a transaction violates these rules, it is automatically rolled back and the database remains in a consistent state.

### Isolation

Isolation refers to the ability of multiple transactions to execute concurrently without interfering with each other. Transactions are isolated from each other, so that any changes made by one transaction do not affect the results of another. This ensures that each transaction appears to be executing serially, even though they are executing concurrently.

### Durability

Durability refers to the requirement that the changes made by a committed transaction must persist, even if the system fails. This means that the database must be able to recover from failures and ensure that committed transactions are not lost. This is typically achieved through the use of write-ahead logging, where changes are first written to a log and then applied to the database, ensuring that committed transactions are stored and can be recovered in the event of a failure.

Overall, the ACID properties ensure that transactions are executed in a reliable, consistent, and isolated manner, providing strong guarantees for data integrity and consistency in transactional systems.
