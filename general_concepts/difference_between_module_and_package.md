# Difference between Module and Package in Python

In Python, the terms "module" and "package" have distinct meanings:

1. **Module**: A module is a single file that contains Python code (e.g. definitions, statements, etc.). A module can be imported into other modules, allowing you to reuse its code and split your program into smaller, more manageable parts.

2. **Package**: A package is a collection of modules stored in a directory structure. It provides a way to organize related modules into a single namespace, which makes it easier to manage the modules and keep the code organized.

In summary, a module is a single file of Python code, while a package is a collection of modules stored in a directory structure.
