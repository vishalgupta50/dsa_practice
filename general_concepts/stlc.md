# Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)

The software testing lifecycle (STLC) is a systematic approach to testing a software application. It typically includes the following phases:

1. **Requirements gathering and analysis**: Understanding the requirements and creating a test plan.
2. **Test design**: Creating test cases, test scripts, and test data.
3. **Test environment setup**: Preparing the test environment and configuring the necessary tools and infrastructure.
4. **Test execution**: Executing the test cases and reporting any defects found.
5. **Test results analysis**: Reviewing the test results, tracking defects, and verifying fixes.
6. **Test closure**: Documenting the test results, cleaning up the test environment, and storing the test artifacts for future reference.

It is important to note that the STLC is an iterative process and may involve multiple cycles of testing and bug fixing before the software is deemed ready for release. Additionally, different organizations may have variations in their specific STLC processes.
